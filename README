This was uploaded much later for the purposes of allowing public and, more specifically, interviewer access if/when necessary. 
Note that the other contributor, Benjamin Liu, is not listed under this repository because they do not have a GitHub account. 
For similar reasons, none of the specific pushes and contributions are present here. 
However, even though I primarily worked on the Classroom API side and Ben worked on the Discord bot, 
there was plenty of overlap in what we did to ensure proper integration.
